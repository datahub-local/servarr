# Servarr

This project is a complete Servarr Helm Chart that includes also Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, qBitTorrent, Jellyseerr, Jellyfin and Flaresovlerr as sub-charts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Helm
- Kubernetes Cluster (for testing purposes)
- Python 3

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/fonzdm/servarr.git && cd servarr
```

2. Retrieve the dependencies

```shell
$ helm dependency update
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the previous command fails or goes in timeout (or takes too much), try adding the truecharts Helm repository:
> ```shell
> $ helm repo add truecharts https://charts.truecharts.org
> ```
> and then execute again the `helm dependency update` command.
  
3. Prepare your [`values.yaml`](#values)
4. Try it in your cluster to check that everything is fine (replace the `servarr/` with the chart folder if your workdir is different):

```shell
$ helm install servarr-dev servarr/ \
--namespace servarr-dev \
--create-namespace \
--values values.yaml
```

## Deployment

To deploy the Helm Chart:

1. Add the Helm repository:

```shell
$ helm repo add fonzdm https://fonzdm.github.io/servarr
```

2. Install the release:

```shell
$ helm install <release-name> fonzdm/servarr \
--namespace servarr \
--create-namespace \
--values values.yaml
```

If you want to install a specific version, execute the previous command adding: `--version x.y.z`
